# nupkg2dll - Nupkg to DLL Converter

nupkg2dll is a small program to easily convert all Nuget packages into simple DLL libraries that can be imported as references on Visual Studio
Useful if you are unwilling or unable to install a Nuget package on Visual Studio

### How to use
using it is easy, just open the little program and select a nupkg file of your choice, and click on "Extract", waiting a few seconds a folder named "extracted" will appear with the converted DLL library.

Or you can just drag the nupkg file to the "nupkg2dll.exe" program and the file will be converted automatically

After the conversion the program will show the folder with all the converted DLLs
